I'm still working on pulling EC2 Instance List. As well in future I will be adding few page style to output.

In order for this to work for you account. You will need to change accessKeyId and secretAccessKey in auth.json file.

Do the following to start the server
	1. npm install 				(you will only need to do this once)
	2. ./startServer.sh 		(to start the server by default I have set th port to 3000 
								Everytime you make changes to you code you will not need to stop and start the process. Nodemon is working!)
	3. In web browser type localhost:3000
